RubenWriter is a fullscreen app for curious toddlers to type letters/numbers without being able to
do anything else (like delete important files.) You can type letters or numbers, which will appear
on the screen.

Press CTRL+SHIFT+ESCAPE to escape; if it doesn't work the first time, press it repeatedly.
